# Rose d'Argent Immobilier - Website Project

Welcome to the repository for **Rose d'Argent Immobilier**, a real estate agency website that I'm developing as part of my web development journey.

## 🏗 Project Overview

I'm building this project in **two phases**:

1. **Version 1 (Basic Implementation)**  
   - Built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL**  
   - Purpose: Establish a working version of the site while getting a solid grasp of the project structure.

2. **Version 2 (Modern Implementation)**  
   - Rebuilt using **Laravel and Vue.js**  
   - Purpose: Improve performance, maintainability, and user experience with a more scalable tech stack.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Develop a **dynamic real estate listing platform** for Rose d'Argent Immobilier.  
- Synchronize listings via **ImmoFacile**, the agency’s management software.  
- Build a **structured, professional codebase** with proper Git versioning.  
- Ensure a smooth transition from a **basic PHP site** to a **modern Vue.js/Laravel application**.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Version | Stack |
|---------|-------|
| V1 | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL |
| V2 | Laravel, Vue.js, TailwindCSS |

## 🔄 Workflow & Versioning

- The project follows a **Git branching strategy** to keep development structured.  
- **Main branch**: Holds stable releases.  
- **Feature branches**: Used for adding or testing new functionality.  

## 📌 Current Status

I'm currently working on **Version 1**, setting up the core structure with PHP and MySQL. The transition to Vue.js and Laravel will come once the first version is stable.

Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
